# Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program: Capstone

This Snake Game is based on stater [repo](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game) for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The current project improve the original classes, uncoupling the SDL from the core classes, so another libraries can be used. It also add some new features such as: 
 
* Process the snake’s collision check in another thread;
* Add some simple game state like `splash screen`, `game over`, `pause game` and so on;
* Use the FSM (Finite State Machine) to uncouple each game states in their own classes and execute just one at a time.
* Add SDL’s font to the game and store its text on texture, saving memory.

## Basic Build Instructions

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/v-borg/cpp-snake-game.git

# change the current directory to the used by the repo
cd cpp-snake-game

# make a build directory and change the current directory to it
mkdir build && cd $_

# execute `cmake` command to prepare the project to be compiled
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON

# execute `make` to compile the project
make

# run the project executable
./src/cpp_snake_game
```

## Build with [Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)

The unit testing is useful to ensures the code will not brake while the project is evolving. Moreover, it can help other programmers to understand the code behavior easier.
 
This repo uses [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) and [Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googlemock) to do the tests. 
You can find that tests [here](tests/), with the main behavior classes' explained, although it is not compiled by default. 

If you are going to run this tests with the project, some additional commands are needed:

```bash
# make sure to clone the repo using `--recursive-module` from git command
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/v-borg/cpp-snake-game.git

# IMPORTANT!
# if the repos was already cloned without the `--recursive-submodules` command, 
# you can ignore the above command and still use the command below to ensure 
# the Google Test and Google Mock will be available at compile time:
#
# git submodule update --init --recursive

# change the current directory to the used by the repo
cd cpp-snake-game

# make a build directory and change the current directory to it
mkdir build && cd $_

# execute `cmake` command with CMake's `BUILD_TEST` as `ON` to prepare the project 
# and their tests to be compiled
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON

# execute `make` to compile the project
make

# run the tests and the project executable as well
./tests/order
./src/cpp_snake_game
```
