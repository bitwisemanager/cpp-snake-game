# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

```console
$ # clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/v-borg/cpp-snake-game.git
$
$ # change the current directory to the used by the repo
$ cd cpp-snake-game
$
$ # make a build directory and change the current directory to it
$ mkdir build && cd $_
$
$ # execute `cmake` command to prepare the project to be compiled
$ cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
$
$ # execute `make` to compile the project
$ make
$
$ # run the project executable
$ ./src/cpp_snake_game
```

## Build with [Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)

The unit testing is useful to ensures the code will not brake while the project is evolving. Moreover, it can help other programmers to understand the code behavior easier.
 
This repo uses [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) and [Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googlemock) to do the tests. 
You can find that tests [here](tests/), with the main behavior classes' explained, although it is not compiled by default. 

If you are going to run this tests with the project, some additional commands are needed:

```console
$ # make sure to clone the repo using `--recursive-module` from git command
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/v-borg/cpp-snake-game.git
$
$ # IMPORTANT!
$ # if the repos was already cloned without the `--recursive-submodules` command, 
$ # you can ignore the above command and still use the command below to ensure 
$ # the Google Test and Google Mock will be available at compile time:
$ #
$ # git submodule update --init --recursive
$
$ # change the current directory to the used by the repo
$ cd cpp-snake-game
$
$ # make a build directory and change the current directory to it
$ mkdir build && cd $_
$
$ # execute `cmake` command with CMake's `BUILD_TEST` as `ON` to prepare the project 
$ # and their tests to be compiled
$ cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
$
$ # execute `make` to compile the project
$ make
$
$ # run the tests and the project executable as well
$ ./tests/order
$ ./src/cpp_snake_game
```
